Whether it\'s the modular bass architecture of neuro purists or the bounce-heavy crowd devastation of jump-up anthems, the coherence is absolute: this is drum & bass as competitive sport, where technical prowess and dancefloor destruction are scored equally.",\n    "track_count": 22,\n    "candidates": [\n      {\n        "title": "Lou Bega",\n        "artist": "Mambo No. 5 (Official Instrumental)",\n        "year": 2019,\n        "comment": "Drum and Bass; Jump-Up; bouncy bassline, chopped vocal stabs, energetic breaks, playful sampling homage; rowdy UK rave energy; UK, late 2010s."\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Soundboy Don\'t Push Your Luck",\n        "artist": "Sully",\n        "year": 2018,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Jump-up; aggressive bassline stabs, energetic breaks, heavyweight sub pressure; peak-time dancefloor ammunition with attitude; UK, late 2"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Nan Slapper",\n        "artist": "Bou,B Live",\n        "year": 2023,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Jump-up; thunderous bassline drops, chopped vocal stabs, relentless energy; peak-time festival mayhem and rave destruction; UK, 2023."\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Nan Slapper",\n        "artist": "Bou,B Live",\n        "year": 2023,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Jump-Up; aggressive bassline wobbles, razor-sharp drums, high-energy breaks; rowdy festival mosh pit energy; UK, 2023."\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "The Spark",\n        "artist": "Kabin Crew,Lisdoonvarna Crew",\n        "year": 2024,\n        "comment": "Drum and Bass; Jump-Up; aggressive bassline wobbles, punchy breaks, high-energy drops; peak-time festival mayhem meets underground rave intensity; UK,"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Super Sharp Shooter - Chris Gialanze Remix",\n        "artist": "DJ Zinc, Chris Gialanze",\n        "year": 2023,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Jump-Up; thunderous bassline rolls, chopped vocal stabs, relentless energy; peak-time dancefloor destroyer for UK rave crowds; UK, 2023 m"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "The Spark",\n        "artist": "Kabin Crew,Lisdoonvarna Crew",\n        "year": 2024,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Jump-Up; aggressive reese basslines, razor-sharp breaks, high-energy rollers; peak-time dancefloor mayhem; UK-influenced, contemporary 20"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Skipped Skits",\n        "artist": "Fixate",\n        "year": 2022,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Halftime; gritty bass stabs, syncopated breaks, heavy sub-weight, aggressive sound design; dark warehouse energy; UK, early 2020s."\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Skipped Skits",\n        "artist": "Fixate",\n        "year": 2022,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Neurofunk; razor-sharp reese bass, intricate break programming, clinical production; high-energy dancefloor weapon; UK, early 2020s under"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "G Power 4",\n        "artist": "Moldover",\n        "year": 2015,\n        "comment": "Drum and Bass; Neurofunk; razor-sharp breaks, aggressive bassline modulations, surgical sound design; high-octane underground energy; UK-influenced, 2"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Shada Shada",\n        "artist": "Fracture,Nah Eeto",\n        "year": 2021,\n        "comment": "Halftime Drum & Bass; Experimental Bass; chopped vocal stabs, skittering hi-hats, heavy sub-bass drops; dark UK underground sound system energy; UK, e"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "MidBass3\\u00b0%/??",\n        "artist": "DJ Shiftee",\n        "year": 2015,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Neurofunk; razor-sharp mid-range bass stabs, surgical sound design, aggressive breaks; dark warehouse energy for technical mixing showcas"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Pistolwhip",\n        "artist": "Instinct (UK)",\n        "year": 2020,\n        "comment": "Drum & Bass; Neurofunk; razor-sharp bass modulations, aggressive percussion, clinical sound design; dark warehouse energy with surgical precision; UK,"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Baddadan (feat.

These tracks represent the moment when R&B learned to think big, building cathedrals of sound that would define sophisticated Black music for the next decade and influence everything from disco to house.",\n    "track_count": 10,\n    "candidates": [\n      {\n        "title": "Do It Any Way You Wanna",\n        "artist": "People\'s Choice",\n        "year": 1975,\n        "comment": "Disco; Philly Soul; infectious horn stabs, funky guitar wah, punchy brass arrangements, groovy bass line; peak dancefloor euphoria from the City of Br"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "It Only Takes A Minute",\n        "artist": "Tavares",\n        "year": 1975,\n        "comment": "Disco; Philly Soul; lush orchestral strings, tight horn stabs, falsetto harmonies, infectious four-on-the-floor groove; classic American dancefloor eu"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Love\'s Theme",\n        "artist": "The Love Unlimited Orchestra",\n        "year": 1998,\n        "comment": "Disco; Orchestral Soul; lush string arrangements, funky bass lines, sweeping symphonic crescendos; opulent dancefloor elegance meets Philly soul sophi"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Love Train",\n        "artist": "The O\'Jays",\n        "year": 1972,\n        "comment": "Soul; Philadelphia Soul; lush orchestration, soaring horns, infectious handclaps, uplifting strings; joyous dancefloor anthem spreading unity and posi"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Me and Mrs. Jones",\n        "artist": "Billy Paul",\n        "year": 1999,\n        "comment": "Soul; Philly Soul; lush orchestral strings, smooth vocal delivery, subtle percussion; intimate late-night slow-jam atmosphere; Philadelphia, early 70s"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Use Ta Be My Girl",\n        "artist": "The O\'Jays",\n        "year": 1978,\n        "comment": "Soul; Philadelphia Soul; lush orchestral strings, smooth vocal harmonies, punchy horns, polished disco-influenced production; glamorous late-70s dance"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "It\'s Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me",\n        "artist": "Barry White",\n        "year": 2001,\n        "comment": "Disco; Orchestral Soul; lush string arrangements, sensual bassline, opulent production; romantic late-night grooves from the Maestro of Love; US, late"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "The Same Love That Made Me Laugh",\n        "artist": "Bill Withers",\n        "year": 1974,\n        "comment": "Soul; Orchestral Soul; lush string arrangements, steady groove, melancholic vocals, warm production; intimate heartbreak anthem for sophisticated danc"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Midnight Train to Georgia",\n        "artist": "Gladys Knight & The Pips",\n        "year": 2009,\n        "comment": "Soul; Southern Soul; lush orchestral strings, gospel-tinged vocals, cinematic arrangement, punchy horns; romantic journey through heartbreak and devot"\n      },\n      {\n        "title": "Use Ta Be My Girl",\n        "artist": "The O\'Jays",\n        "year": 1978,\n        "comment": "Philadelphia Soul; Smooth Soul; lush string arrangements, warm horn sections, silky vocal harmonies; heartbreak on the dancefloor with sophisticated P"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nReturn a JSON array:\n[{\n  "id": "collection-id",\n  "title": "Refined Title",\n  "description": "A rich paragraph — evocative, knowledgeable, vivid...",\n  "examples": [\n    {"title": "Track Title", "artist": "Artist Name", "year": 2001},\n    ...\n  ]\n}]'}], 'model': 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929', 'system': 'You are a music curator with encyclopedic knowledge of genres, scenes, and cultural movements.

The cluster holds strongest around Crescent City natives, though War\'s Chicano funk shares that laid-back, polyrhythmic sensibility. This is music for slow cruising, brass-heavy street parades, and understanding that the space between notes matters as much as the notes themselves.",\n    "track_count": 36,\n    "candidates": [\n      {\n        "title": "Chippy, Chippy",\n        "artist": "Dr. John",\n        "year": 1972,\n        "comment": "New Orleans R&B;

The German abstraction of submerged basslines and warped textures contrasts sharply with Mediterranean lounge sophistication, suggesting that by the late 2000s, the European downtempo continuum had fractured into regional dialects.
